Hi, I am Daria!

I was born in Moscow in 1999 and lived there until 14 years old. In 2015, I moved to France and finished high-school with diploma in Economics & Social Sciences. In 2018, I joined ESCP business school to do Bachelors in Management. Throughout my bachelors, I studies across UK, Italy and Germany, and traveled all over Europe. In 2021, I returned back to London and started studying for Masters in Finance at London Business School.

I am passionate about fintech and technology in general - and would love to build my start-up one day! In my free time, I also enjoy writing books (sadly for my non-Russian friends, only in Russian for now) and watching Netflix (no shame). 

I started learning R at LBS and would love to share my knowledge with everyone ineterested!

Enjoy,
Daria
